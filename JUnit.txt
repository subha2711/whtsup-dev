JUnit:
-----------
It is a unit Testing framework for Java programming language.
When a method is attached with @Test, we donot need to use main method.

@Test:
-------------
* It is called Annotation
* This annotation tells JUnit the public void method to which it is attached.

Annotations:
* @BeforeClass	: Run once before any of the test methods in the class
* @Before		: Run before @Test   
* @Test		: This is the test method to run and can be more than 1
* @After		: Run after @Test
* @AfterClass	: Run once after all the tests in the class have been run

When there are more than 1 @test, then the first @test will run along with the before and after test. For the next @ test, it will run again with the before and after test.

Each time @Test has to run, it runs with before and after. once the cycle is completed then for then next @Test it starts with @before then @Test and then the @After.

This process continues untill all @Test has run.
This type of Testing is calledas Modular Testing

@BeforeClass and @AfterClass happenes only once irrespective of number of @Test.
